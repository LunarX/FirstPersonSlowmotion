# Description
This project is a game, whose goal is the interact with the player, by the intermediar of his/her stress.  
A software, (see https://github.com/habom2310/Heart-rate-measurement-using-camera) is used to measure the heartbeat, by using the camera of the laptop.  
The difficulty of the game is then adapted to this value (high stress meaning decrease the difficulty, and vice versa)
